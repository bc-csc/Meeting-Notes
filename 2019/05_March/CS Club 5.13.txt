Computer Science Club 
Makerspace Conference room
May 13, 2019 




Evan and Liam are basically co-presidential 


What we want to do as CS Club: 
* Sub committee will be formed for hackathons
* Multiple meetings throughout the week- whatever works best for people
* Different leads in club ⇒ for different projects (will have their own meetings) And have catch up meetings(for everyone) whether in an email or in person
* We are going to do projects and competitions to apply our degree to projects and competitions
* Do hackathon, competition teams- we can potentially go to hackathons to participate in other states and get funding from the school. 
* Horizontal structure, so different sizing for teams so they are easy to take apart
* CS club is facilitating CS, IT, or stem degrees(anyone can be able to join the club/ but not too general 
* Peer to peer tutoring and social from people in cs and having issues with projects. 


Meetings will consist of:
Run down at beginning of meeting
-Check in: what do we want to get in, or talk about an event coming up, if anyone has any major questions
Second half of meeting: getting coding questions answered and social


Social (things to do):
Need to have more efficient notification announcement: (github, email, discord, snapchat)
WE NEED TO HAVE ALL CONTACT INFORMATION FOR MEMBERS:
Projects on github is basically a todo list


Maybe move to slack and discord⇒ instructions to set up slack on discord 
        -slack is more professional for industry
Make a club snapchat (Albert is making snapchat)
Public google drive folder for the club (someone need to make this)
Restricting people posting in all (social platforms): who can post and where they can post 
        -Private repo - github to put everyone’s contact information on there to keep it private to members only












Projects (things to do):
* We have to make a quarter project that we will keep out there and so we can jointly work on it outside of the meetings
* Albert: wants research wing of club- which he will take up most responsibilities 
* Make club member tiers
* On our pages we are going to have resume help
* Everyone is going to have use git
We want to workshops (like github workshop- like beginning of each quarter) to catch up new members
Leadership be familiar with roberts rules (not as rigid): just for structure of meetings 
Let's start hackathon searching now: and considering a hackathon for fall need 
Hackathon capture the flag teams
